= Scheveningen

Schevening is a Dutch linguistics collection (aspire to be library) of code
forms, draft texts, expressions and file or otherwise annotated references
of information.

It forms the collection of some not easily to come by Dutch NLP (Natural
Language Processing, not neuro-linguistic programming as you will easily Google)


== Etymology

Schevening (here often abbreviated as the shorter "sch" - for its easily the
most characteristical compound of the name) is a Dutch linguistics library.

If there were a list of most characteristical and equally hard to pronounce
sounds, the voiceless velar fricative /x/ (s+ch) which is commonly found in
the http://fransdejonge.com/2009/12/voiced-velar-fricative-above-all/[Dutch language]
and pronounced in English as in the Scottish word for lake: "Loch". Also some
Scottish last names may be commonly found that correctly need to be pronounced
as such, 'Maclachlan' being one example that comes to mind.

Very few sounds actually get banned from languages but the this one sure did
and from the Middle Ages onward has been slowly pushed out of modern day English
where the sound is non-existent. The association of someone vomiting or choking
is often made, some might call its nature 'aggressive' or 'harsh' depending
on cultural aspects of listeners. One should add however that not all Dutch and
especially not Belgians would prefer to pronounce the word "Scheveningen" with
the voiceless velar fricative, but that is how most of us in the relevant parts
(lol) of the country (read: Noord-Brabant and Holland) do.

The name is a tribute to and named after the illustrious WWII shibboleth which,
in turn, has its direct root in the name of the Dutch coastal town and harbor.
Since the Germans (de moffen) aren't able to reproduce the sound, it became a
quick and secure friend-or-foe identification between troops on the ground in
the darkness, much as some Americans used the word 'lollapalooza' which is a
rather difficult word to correctly pronounce the first times if you are not
custom to the language on a intimate level.

== Status

Current status may not yet reflect the more encompassing nature of 'library'
in my vocabulary of terms, as in the early stages "collection of scripts,
snippets, ideas and draft texts" hardly together form a coherent whole, the
intent is here to grow part of this theme in a library at some point intended
for reuse as I venture deeper in the science of language. Often enough these
files are the result of some studying of wikipedia articles, structure or any
body of knowledge on a (meta) level in the respect of Clojure. It's both fun
and educational but not too serious in terms of commiting to a hard deadline
on production yet.



This toolkit however, is named 
renowned for its voiceless velar fricative /x/ (s+ch, pronounced as like Loch,
as in Loch Ness)"
